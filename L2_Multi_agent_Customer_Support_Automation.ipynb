            "1. **Access the Crew Settings:**\n",
            "   - Log in to your CrewAI account and navigate to the Crew you want to manage.\n",
            "   - Click on the Crew's settings, usually indicated by a gear icon or a 'Settings' button.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Locate the Memory Section:**\n",
            "   - In the Crew settings, find the 'Memory' or 'Knowledge Base' section. This is where you can manage and add new memory items.\n",

            "3. **Add Memory Items:**\n",
            "   - Click on the 'Add Memory' or 'Create Memory' button. This will open a form where you can input the memory content.\n",
            "   - Here's what you can typically add:\n",
            "     - **Memory Title:** A concise and descriptive title for the memory.\n",
            "     - **Memory Content:** This is the main body of the memory, where you can add text, images, documents, or any relevant information.\n",
            "     - **Tags:** Assign tags to categorize and organize your memories for easy retrieval.\n",
            "     - **Source:** If the memory is based on an external source, you can provide a reference here.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Save and Organize:**\n",
            "   - Once you've added the memory content, click 'Save' or 'Create' to store it in your Crew's knowledge base.\n",
            "   - You can repeat this process to add multiple memory items.\n",
            "   - Consider creating folders or categories to organize related memories, making it easier for your team to find relevant information.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Accessing and Sharing Memory:**\n",
            "   - Crew members can access the memory through the Crew's interface, usually a dedicated 'Knowledge' or 'Memory' tab.\n",
            "   - Encourage your team to utilize the search function to find specific memories quickly.\n",
